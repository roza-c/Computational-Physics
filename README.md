### Lab Projects

Each lab is contained in its own folder. Below is a summary of each project.

* **Lab 1: Numerical Errors and Simple Integration**
    * This lab explores numerical errors in standard deviation calculations, the effects of roundoff error in polynomial expansions, and the efficiency of the Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules for integration.

* **Lab 2: Numerical Derivatives and Gaussian Quadrature**
    * This lab applies numerical methods to calculate the potential energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator, find the period of a relativistic particle on a spring, and analyze the accuracy of different numerical differentiation schemes.

* **Lab 3: Fourier Transforms**
    * This lab focuses on signal analysis using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It includes filtering an audio file, analyzing long-term trends in stock market data, and decomposing sea level pressure data into its constituent waves.

* **Lab 4: Solving Partial Differential Equations**
    * This lab implements numerical solutions for partial differential equations (PDEs), including using the Gauss-Seidel method to solve Laplace's equation for a capacitor, simulating the shallow water equations, and modeling wave propagation with Burger's equation.

* **Lab 5: Monte Carlo Methods**
    * This lab uses random processes to model physical systems. It includes a simulation of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA), using simulated annealing to find the minimum of complex functions, and applying importance sampling to solve challenging integrals.
